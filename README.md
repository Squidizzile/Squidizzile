- 👋 Hi, I’m Eli. I am a .NET/Java Developer from the States, ready to boost and grow my skills
- 👀 I’m interested in deepening my knowledge of C# (.NET, ASP.NET MVC), Java, C++, Python, Node.js and SQL to further
- advance my back-end skills. I'm also interested in elevating my front-end skills (e.g., HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript) to
- become a full-stack developer, video game developer, machine learning engineer and desktop app developer. I aspire to get into
- mobile app development, preferably iOS development with Swift, and to broaden my strong communication skills with any team I am a part of
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# (.NET Framework, ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 6)), C++(20), Java (JavaFX, Java Web Application and more)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a small or medium scale group for web, app or desktop app development, or in a large group for machine learning and AI development
